        <h3>Visual Design</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            To critique the visual design of the website I will be selecting elements from the website that 
            utilise the design principles Jacci Howard Bear identified in her article Principles of Design (2015) 
            (http://desktoppub.about.com/od/designprinciples/). 
            I will then discuss how these principles were applied to these elements and 
            the impact that this will have on users of the website.

        <h3>Color Scheme and Contrast</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <figure id="figImgGreyText">
                <img id="imgGreyText" src="img/greyText.PNG" alt="greyText">
                <figcaption class="figure">Figure 1. screenshot of 'stack overflow' for showing grey text on a page</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>All the interface elements on 'stack overflow' use a white and blue color scheme. This is good as it increases the continuity between pages and creates a sense of familiarity with users when they navigate to a new page on the website. Making the background white creates excellent contrast with the black text on the page making it very easy to read.
                <br><br>
                There are some drawbacks to this grey text. Many text on the website are light grey. It could be not a good color for readability depends on monitors.<i>(Figure 1.)</i>
                <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <figure id="figImageContrastText">
                    <img id="imgContrastText" src="img/contrastText.PNG" alt="contrastText">
                    <figcaption class="figure">Figure 2. Contrast text</figcaption>
                </figure>
                There is a contrast text between '0 answer' and 'existing answer'<i>(Figure 2.)</i>. (Bear, J, H. 2015) says that "Contrast helps different design elements stand out". If the box followed the standard color scheme it would be very hard to pick out from certain artworks in the background. On the other hand it may have a different color scheme to contrast it with other elements on the website which will show its importance to the user.
                Using grey for text on the website was not a very good design decision in terms of contrast as it does not make the stand out very much from the white background. This understates the importance of the text and could lead to people skimming over them or not reading them at all as they look for more obvious titles.

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <figure id="figImagefonts">
                <img id="imgFonts" src="img/fonts.PNG" alt="fonts">
                <figcaption class="figure">Figure 3. fonts for the question and the code.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                'Stack overflow' uses different fonts to convey the text and the code at a glance. 
                Consolas and Arial font is what paragraphs of information are written in this is a good design choice for two reasons:
                <br><br>
                1. Readers do not want to strain their eyes reading large paragraphs of text. As all the paragraphs are written in these simple Arial fonts they are clear and easy to read. 
                <br><br>
                2. Arial are not particularly eye-catching fonts therefore they do not distract the reader while they are looking at other elements on the page. (Bear, J, H. 2015) quotes "Avoid the temptation to use boldface text to emphasize words within a passage of text. Bold text is like a magnet to our eyes, and if used incorrectly, ruins the continuity of your text."

        <h3>Balance and White Space</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Stack overflow uses balance and the distribution of white space to focus users attention on the important content on the website and establish consistency between pages on the website. The elements on the ‘Questions’, ‘Developers jobs’, 'Tags' and ‘Users’ pages on the site are arranged inside a central column. There are blocks of whitespace on either side of this column between the elements on the page and the edge of the page. (Bear, J, H. 2015) says this is a symmetrical style of balance as 'the page elements are centered' The similarity in balance between these two pages is good as it means users will know where to look on the page to see the content. This style of balance also creates a sense of order on the website as no single side of the page seems ‘heavier’ or more cluttered than the other.

        <h3>Proximity and Unity</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Many pages on 'Stack overflow' have multiple elements that discuss similar topics or convey related information. The website groups these elements together and borders them with light grey lines. (Bear, J, H. 2015) quotes that it is important to ‘help the viewer understand complex pages or information-packed layouts by using proximity to bring together elements that go together’ This is an excellent example of proximity in action that lets users know that the grouped elements are all related while the light grey lines reinforce that they are all separate elements.
                <br><br>
                'Stack overflow' usually separates unrelated elements by placing them on different pages. For example all the information about the 'developers jobs' service is located on the developers jobs page therefore there is no need to separate the elements on that page as they are all related to the developers jobs in some way. Because of how rarely the website clearly has to separate elements on pages there is no established visual design technique employed to do this. The only real example of separating elements on the same page would be the navigation bar. This is done by keeping the navigation bar the same when everything else on the page changes - if the content changes and the navigation bar does not then the navigation bar cannot be related to the rest of the elements on the page displaying the content. This causes users to disassociate the bar with the rest of the content on the page much in the same way proximity does.
                <br><br>
                Proximity is used to make the navigation bar very intuitive however a few oddly placed elements can confuse users. There is a section for the 'open job' on the right on website on the first page next qustions. (Bear, J, H. 2015) says that 'how close together objects are placed can suggest a relationship'. This can mislead users into thinking that these section is also for questions and answers as they are close to the question list. This means that users may have difficulty finding the unity. The rest of the elements on the navigation bar are grouped together very intuitively which makes the navigation bar very easy to use and means users can identify the functionality of elements based purely on their position.

        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <figure id="figImageRepetition">
                <img id="imgRepetition" src="img/Repetition01.PNG" alt="Repetition01">
                <figcaption class="figure">Figure 4. page for home.</figcaption>
                <img id="imgRepetition" src="img/Repetition02.PNG" alt="Repetition02">
                <figcaption class="figure">Figure 5. page for questions.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure id="figImageRepetition">
                <img id="imgRepetition" src="img/Repetition03.PNG" alt="Repetition03">
                <figcaption class="figure">Figure 6. page for jobs.</figcaption>
                <img id="imgRepetition" src="img/Repetition04.PNG" alt="fonts">
                <figcaption class="figure">Figure 7. page for tags.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                <i>(Figure 4,5,6,7)</i> show that the content on the pages are aligned to the center.
                <br><br>
                According to (Bear, J, H. 2015) ‘Repeating the… placement of elements... provides a comforting rhythm to a publication’. 
                <br><br>
                Repetition is used to great effect on the blog page of the website. All the titles on the page are colored light blue and use ‘Arial’ font family, and all the paragraphs are in standard Consolas. This allows the user to quickly identify what text is important and what text isn’t. It also makes it more obvious when users start reading a new question as they will see the big blue text.
                <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Text and images on the rest of the website are usually aligned to the center or are in a grid formation. This is an excellent design choice as it makes them easy to read and understand. (Bear, J, H. 2015) says that good alignment creates 'attractive, readable pages'. Constantly breaking alignment would make text difficult to read making the website harder to use and frustrating visitors.
