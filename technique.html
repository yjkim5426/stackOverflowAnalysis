            <h3>Technique Details</h3>

                    <img id="imgHowfast" src="img/howfast.PNG" alt="howfast">

                    I used various online tools to find out what server-side and client-side technologies were used to create Chordify.net. These tools included Netcraft.com’s site report generator which can be found at http://toolbar.netcraft.com/site_report and Builtwith.com’s report generator which can be found at http://builtwith.com/.

            <h3>Server-side Technologies</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <figure id="figServerSide">
                    <img id="imgServerSide" src="img/serverside.PNG" alt="serverside">
                    <figcaption class="figure">Figure 1: NetCraft report on Stackoverflow.com</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Two main server side technologies were indicated by the NetCraft analyses report:
                    Extensible markup language (XML) is used by Stack overflow for the storage and transfer of data within and between servers.
                    Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used by Stack overflow to ensure data security for its databses which house user-uploaded data.
